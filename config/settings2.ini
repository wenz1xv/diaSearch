For itask= -1, set label for extracting thermodynamic quantity, e.g. "G4 Free Energy=" means G4 free energy will be extracted (need to write double quotes!). For itask= 2 or 3, this parameter does not need to be set because free energy is always extracted (however, if template_SP.gjf is presented, this parameter also determines loading which energy from high-level single point task).
